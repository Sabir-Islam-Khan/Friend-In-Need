This is app through which people can get emergency help when needed.

<h1>Prologue</h1>

Recently women harassment has dangerously increased in Bangladesh. It is now one of the major concern in our country. I wanted to do something against this. So i decided to make an android app. In this app, user have to give 5 trusted contacts number. If he/She falls in danger, all she needs to do is to open the app and tap a single button. This app will automatically send SMS to those 5 people. The SMS will contain a google maps which will provide users current location. And this app will also calculate the closest police station from user and send the same SMS to Officer in Charge there. And the most cool thing about this app is that, all these things would work in completely offline mode.  Now, lets hop right into the depth and see how to use it and how its made.
